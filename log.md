# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: October 7, 2020 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I began the Responsive Web Design program. It started with Basic HTML and HTML5 exercises on FreeCodeCamp(www.freecodecamp.com/learn) which consisted of 28 lessons which I completed 100%(28/28). I also watched 2 hours of the youtube video from freeCodeCamp channel(https://youtu.be/mU6anWqZJcc) which is 11 hours and 30 minutes(I'm 10hours into it now).

**Thoughts**: I was introduced to HTML in high school(2009) when I attended an enrichment program known as Clemson Emerging Scholars. During that time we were taught the basic elements so Day 1 of #100DaysOfCode was easy to complete because I remembered quite a few elements.

### Day 2: October 8, 2020 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Basic CSS exercises on FreeCodeCamp(www.freecodecamp.com/learn) which consisted of 44 lessons which I completed 100%(44/44). 

**Thoughts**: Learned about overriding styles in CSS. The second declaration of a class will always take precendence over the first. I have always wondered whether an id or class can override each other, and turns out id overrides class. Also the "!important" keyword overrides all to make sure that the element has specific CSS.

### Day 3: October 9, 2020 Friday

**Today's Progress**: I began the exercises on Applied Visual Design on FreeCodeCamp(www.freecodecamp.com/learn). Didn't get the chance to finish the last hour of [HTML5 & CSS3 from scratch - Full Course](https://youtu.be/mU6anWqZJcc) which I began watching in the early part of this year. I actually watched [Introduction to Responsive Web Design - HTML & CSS](https://youtu.be/srvUrASNj0s).

**Thoughts**: Today was a laid back day for me. I'm still trying to get use to coding everyday. I have previously studied HTML & CSS, but there are a few things I have to refresh on my memory cause there's alot to remember. I'm just on the third day and I feel like I'm doing too much. =( Too many tutorials sorry. I see why the rules say no tutorials this thing can get confusing. But this is my first round. I promise to be better later on in this challenge.

### Day 4: October 10, 2020 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued the exercises on Applied Visual Design on FreeCodeCamp(www.freecodecamp.com/learn). What stood out to me was the lesson about the Hue of a Color and Scaling. Played around with the different colors and scaling today a tad bit.

**Thoughts**: It's the weekend and I had plans to do over an hour today but unfortuantely I did not have much time. The variety of colors are amazing and the different values you use to show them are quite interesting. The hsl value which was introduced in CSS3 uses a color wheel concept and not a spectrum. *Hmmm I love this already. I get to choose any color*.

Examples of color values: 
```
rgb(0, 0, 255)
#0000FF
hsl(240, 100%, 50%)
```

### Day 5: October 11, 2020 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Responsive Web Design: Applied Visual Design on freeCodeCamp. Learned about creating 2D graphics & using keyframes to manipulate animations in CSS. 

A few animation properties:
```
animation-name
animation-duration
animation-timing-function
animation-delay
animation-iteration-count
```

**Thoughts**: 2D graphics are good, but I cant wait until I'm able to do 3D. Drawing a heart and cresent was neat. To be able to manipulate animations is superb. Getting those animations to do exactly what you want them to do I'm amazed.

### Day 6: October 12, 2020 Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Completed 55% of Applied Accessibility on freeCodeCamp. Learned about the new elements that were introduced in HTML5 to make a web design more accessibile. What I learned today was these elements which make the screen reader navigation more simple:`<header>` `<nav>` `<main>` `<article>` `<section>` `<footer>`. 

Also here's a few topics that were covered:
1. Headings Hierarchical
2. Accessibility of Audio content
3. Chart Accessibility using `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`element
4. Form Field Accessibility using `<label>` element
5. Accessibility of Radio Buttons `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` element

**Thoughts**: The new elements introduced in HTML5 gives a better understanding rather than using so many `<div>` element giving it a class or id. How magical is this? I'm definitely going to start using these new elements hopefully it will make it make sense.

### Day 7: October 13, 2020 Tuesday 

**Today's Progress**: Completed 100% of Responsive Web Design: Applied Accessibility section on freeCodeCamp. Worked on my site I started on yesterday and the link is listed below. I have plans to finish it.

Here is a few topics that were covered:
1. Accessible Date Picker & Standard Time `<time datetime="2020-10-20">` 
2. Visually Hide Content in CSS `overflow: hidden;`
3. Avoiding Color Blindness Issues
4. Using brief descriptive text with `<a>` tag
5. Making Links Navigable in HTML with `accesskey` and `tabindex` attributes

**Thoughts**: So I decided to apply some of these topics into creating my own site and I realized that I'm struggling setting up the margins or padding of the content. I can picture how I want my page to be but I can't seem to get it together. Maybe I'm just thinking too hard about it. Putting them into a container sounds best for me, but I still get so confused.

### Day 8: October 14, 2020 Wednesday 

**Today's Progress**: Completed 100% of Responsive Web Design Principles section on freeCodeCamp. Made some changes to the web page I'm creating on Accessibility couldn't figure out why the images were out of the container. 

Here is a few topics that were covered today:
1. Media Queries
2. Making a Image Responsive
3. Using Retina Images for Higher Resoulution Display
4. Making Typography Responsive 

**Thoughts**: The images were wider than the container when I resized the page.(solved it) All I had to do was add the img selector to the CSS stylesheet, then add `max-width` property, and set it to 100% and this makes sure the image is never wider than the container. The `height` property will have a value of auto which keeps the original aspect ratio. Can't wait to get into the Flexbox and Grid section so I would not fear setting up the layout on my own.

### Day 9: October 15, 2020 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Watched freeCodeCamp video on [Introduction to Responsive Web Design - HTML & CSS](https://youtu.be/srvUrASNj0s). Also changed a few things that I learned on Applied Accessibility(see link below). 

**Thoughts**: Today was kinda a rough day, so I decided to watch a video. Didn't get the chance to get into the next section on [freeCodeCamp](www.freecodecamp.com/learn). Didn't come up with a new name for Applied Accessibility web page I created.

### Day 10: October 16, 2020 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Began the lesson [CSS Flexbox on freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/css-flexbox/). 

Here is what I learned:
1. `display: flex;`add to a element when you want to add flex container to
2. `flex-direction`property to align any children of that element into rows or columns. 
3. To fill all the spaces or align container use `justify-content` or `align-items` property

**Thoughts**: Will be doing this for a few days the fact being that this is not my first time doing seeing flexbox and I feel like I would need alot of repetition to fully understand each property of the flexbox. Yesterday Day 9 video that I watched was very helpful because I got to visually see how it is done, so that is great. I'll be working on different types of layouts that I can come up with.

### Day 11: October 17, 2020 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed [CSS Flexbox on freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/css-flexbox/). Also I used the site [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) which was very helpful also. 

Here are the properties I learned today about Flexbox:

1. `flex-wrap` splits a flex item into multiple rows or columns
2. `flex-shrink` allows an item to shrink the flex container, it takes numbers as values
3. `flex-grow` is the opposite of shrink it grows the flex container
4. `flex-basis` specifies the initial size of item before CSS makes adjustments
5. The short hand for flex is `flex: (flex-grow) (flex-shrink) (flex-basis) ;`
6. `align-self` allows you to adjust each item's alignment individually instead of setting them all at once

**Thoughts**: This is going good CSS Flexbox isn't that hard as I was making it seem in the beginning. On the Flexbox Froggy site there was a property that was not introduced in freeCodeCamp's lesson which is `flex-flow` which has the values for the flex-direction and flex-wrap. Example, `flex-flow: (flex-direction) (flex-wrap);`

### Day 12: October 18, 2020 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my Flexbox webpage. Also did some more research on flexbox to get a better understanding from different point of views.

**Thoughts**: Relied on [CSS Flexible Box Layout](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/) for the standard for flex box, but someone who can explain it without so much detail is what I prefered.

### Day 13: October 19, 2020 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Began lesson on [CSS Grid on freeodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/css-grid/). Rewatched first 2 hours of freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design from Day 9 plan to finish the other 2 hours soon.

Here's what I learned today:

1. Set `display: grid`to turn into a grid container
2. Units to Change the Size of Columns and Rows( **px**, **em**, **fr**, **auto**, and **%**)
3. `grid-template-columns` will add a set number of columns determined the number of parameters
4. `grid-template-rows` will set add a set number of rows determined the number of parameters
5. `grid-column-gap` creates a gap between the contents columns using the units specified for grid
6. `grid-row-gap` creates a gap between the contents rows using the units specified for grid
7. Shorthand `grid-gap: (grid-row-gap) (grid-column-gap);`

**Thoughts**: This seems alot simpler than Flexbox but in reality it's not because it helps you build complex web designs. I'm sure its more to it than what I learned today; didn't get to finish the whole section. Before its time to do the projects for the Responsive Web Design section I plan to find a video to help me give it more features.

### Day 14: October 20, 2020 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the CSS Grid lesson on freeCode Camp.

Here's what I learned today:

1. `grid-row`
2. `justify-self` and `align-self`
3. `justify-items` and `align-items`
4. Grid Into Area Template `grid-template-areas`
5. Reduce Repetition Using `repeat()` function
6. Limit Item Size Using `minmax()` function
7. Create Flexible Layouts Using `auto-fill` and `auto-fit`

**Thoughts**: Forgot to log yesterday so I'm logging on the next day.. Sorry. But CSS Grid seemed more easier to learn than CSS Flexbox although I did have a problem in the beginning with the grid-column and grid-row properties such as `grid-column: 2 / 4;` ... I get it now.

### Day 15: October 21, 2020 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Started on the first project of Responsive Web Design: Tribute Page. Completed it also in the same day.

**Thoughts**: Didn't think I would be able to complete this project in one day but it was simple and straight to the point

### Day 16: October 22, 2020 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started on the second project of Responsive Web Design: Survey Form. 

**Thoughts**: This was also interesting, but didn't get to finish it. Working with the margins and padding now. Im getting there slowly but surely.

**Link(s) to Work**: 
1. *"I'm Embarassed I'll post it on tomorrow log when I do more work to it"*

### Day 17: October 23, 2020 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Still working on my Survey Form project. Did some more research on the best way to do a layout for a form.

**Thoughts**: When working with a survey form I'd like to center it. Played around with the linear gradient fuction and got a background image to look as if it was fading I thought that was so cool. So I have a background that I want but cant get the input box to strectch will probably have to add a class to it and do it that way it makes more since. Okay going to do that now.

### Day 18: October 24, 2020 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Watched the last 2 hours of the 4 hour video on freeCodeCamp Youtube Channel about Responsive Web Design Video. 

**Thoughts**: I have a lot of thought about creating a blog but I'm strugging with margin and padding

### Day 19: October 25, 2020 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Survey Project on freeCodeCamp website.

**Thoughts**: I've had many challenges trying to complete this project. My main reason why I stopped web design before was because I know how to work the padding and margin properties but I can never get an layout to look even. Learning CSS flexbox and CSS Grid explains alot. Doing this survey form I didn't have to use neither, so I had to do some research on `calc()` function to get my input widths to work properly.

### Day 20: October 26, 2020 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Began [Computer Programming course on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming). In this unit the goal is to learn how to use the JavaScript language and the ProcessingJS library to create fun drawings and animations.

**Thoughts**: This is very interesting because it begins with Drawing and Animation in JavaScript(JS) processing.js library for the first unit. It was fun creating a snowman and giving him arms with the `line` function. I learned that an `ellipse` function value x positions is actually determined from the center of the shape, while the `rect` function starts from the upper left of the shape. *I hope I'm right if I listened correctly.*

### Day 21: October 27, 2020 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued Computer Programming course on Khan Academy.

**Thoughts**: I learned about the fill and stroke function *tbh i already knew this*. Already knew how to add a background it was simple like the property used in CSS just `background`.

### Day 22: October 28, 2020 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the "What's for Dinner" challenge @khanacademy in the Computer Programming course.

**Thoughts**: This challenge was fun to do .. Mind wasn't working right so it took me some time to think of what can I could actually draw using the `ellipse` `rect` and `line` function. Really wanted to draw a fish but just couldn't come up with an actual idea of how it could be drawn at that moment *probably could have drew the ellipse then drew a triangle for the tail*. I'll try that fish out in the future.

### Day 23: October 29, 2020 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to use variables to hold values, and animate drawings with processing library in JS at Khan Academy Computer Programming course.

**Thoughts**:  Refreshed my memory of technical terms like assignment operator.The term camel case is new to me don't believe I've heard it before.

### Day 24: October 30, 2020 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on animations on Computer Programming course at Khan Academy.

**Thoughts**: Worked on incrementing shorcuts such as `x += 1;` which has the same meaning as  `x = x + 1;` or `x++`. This is where math comes in cause you will have to know the right expressions to use to make your program do what you want it to.

### Day 25: October 31, 2020 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to make programs that draw shapes based on the mouse location, also how to use variable expressions to resize parts of your drawing relative to other parts.

**Thoughts**: I wish to complete alot more so i can get to the HTML & CSS session so I can complete my projects on freeCodeCamp don't want to forget what I've learned thus far.

### Day 26: November 1, 2020 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the "Animal attack" challenge at khanacademy. Also worked on how to display text on a canvas, resize it, color it, and animate it.

**Thoughts**: Created a panda on ice but what I wanted the panda to do I just didn't think hard enough on it. I wanted the panda to enlarge it's eyes as the panda is about to attack. The program does that but the eyes aren't porportional as they get bigger.

### Day 27: November 2, 2020 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about how to make code reusable using functions in Javascript, and making those functions accept parameters and return values. Also learned about the mouseMoved function.

**Thoughts**: Remember hearing terms like return statement, local and global variables *i learned about this in java during my undergrad years so it's similar*. Creating a function for a calculator was simple you just need the right symbols and parameters.

### Day 28: November 3, 2020 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Well today is election day and I've been nervous as ever. But today I worked on the "fish tank" project on codeacademy's computer programming course. After I completed this I worked on Bootstrap 3.4.1. 

**Thoughts**: Well to begin with I want my fish to change random colors at random positions. I know how to use the random function but I dont know how to use 3 parameter to pass a rgb value. I'll keep this in mind for future references. Working with Bootstrap I can finally get my webpage to have equal columns just the way I want them (I only wanted 3 max).

### Day 29: November 4, 2020 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the "fish tank" project and I'm satisfied now. Also began working on [Logic and If statements](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/logic-if-statements/pt/if-statements) on khanacademy.

**Thoughts**: Yesterday I logged that I wanted the fish to change colors and I accomplished this today, and it wasn't hard at all. Learning about if statements again brings back memories (*aww I'm relieved*). The bouncy ball challenge was something I wanted to remember how to do and this challenge helped me. The Number Analyzer challenge had me to overthink because I solved it before I even read the direction(*bad decision*) then had to start over and actually go step by step (*this was accomplished too*).

### Day 30: November 5, 2020 Thursday

**Today's Progress**:Finished lesson on Logic and if Statements, and completed the Magic 8-Ball project on KhanAcademy where i used if else statements to show different messages. Also read about debbuging programs (*how to figure out what is wrong with your program*).

**Thoughts**: It can be difficult at times to figure out where you went wrong when you are coding and there is an error. Just take your time and figure it out. 

Using these tips can help when debugging:
- `print()` or `pritnln()` to check values 
- `debug()` to send the output to your browser's JavaScript console
- having an object or person to state the coding process to
- exaggerate your output with extreme or bigger values

### Day 31: November 6, 2020 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about loops in Javascript by using processingJS library on khanacademy. Began working on the "Build-a-House project".

**Thoughts**: Using while loops is similar to if/else if statements being that they both consider conditions. The only difference with the while loop is that it loops how many times you want and prints that each time. You can convert simple while loops into for loops which is a quicker way to tell the computer to initiliaze, and repeat the condition to me. Doing these challenges gave me the change to actually work on my problem solving skills.

The 3 Loop Questions:
- What do I want to repeat?
- What do I want to change each time?
- How long should we repeat?
