# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: October 7, 2020 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I began the Responsive Web Design program. It started with Basic HTML and HTML5 exercises on FreeCodeCamp(www.freecodecamp.com/learn) which consisted of 28 lessons which I completed 100%(28/28). I also watched 2 hours of the youtube video from freeCodeCamp channel(https://youtu.be/mU6anWqZJcc).

**Thoughts** I was introduced to HTML in high school(2009) when I attended an enrichment program known as Clemson Emerging Scholars. During that time we were taught the basic elements so Day 1 of #100DaysOfCode was easy to complete because I remembered quite a few elements.

### Day 2: October 8, 2020 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Basic CSS exercises on FreeCodeCamp(www.freecodecamp.com/learn) which consisted of 44 lessons which I completed 100%(44/44). 

**Thoughts** Learned about overriding styles in CSS. The second declaration of a class will always take precendence over the first. I have always wondered whether an id or class can override each other, and turns out id overrides class. Also the "!important" keyword overrides all to make sure that the element has specific CSS.
