# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: October 7, 2020 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I began the Responsive Web Design program. It started with Basic HTML and HTML5 exercises on FreeCodeCamp(www.freecodecamp.com/learn) which consisted of 28 lessons which I completed 100%(28/28). I also watched 2 hours of the youtube video from freeCodeCamp channel(https://youtu.be/mU6anWqZJcc) which is 11 hours and 30 minutes(I'm 10hours into it now).

**Thoughts**: I was introduced to HTML in high school(2009) when I attended an enrichment program known as Clemson Emerging Scholars. During that time we were taught the basic elements so Day 1 of #100DaysOfCode was easy to complete because I remembered quite a few elements.

### Day 2: October 8, 2020 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Basic CSS exercises on FreeCodeCamp(www.freecodecamp.com/learn) which consisted of 44 lessons which I completed 100%(44/44). 

**Thoughts**: Learned about overriding styles in CSS. The second declaration of a class will always take precendence over the first. I have always wondered whether an id or class can override each other, and turns out id overrides class. Also the "!important" keyword overrides all to make sure that the element has specific CSS.

### Day 3: October 9, 2020 Friday

**Today's Progress**: I began the exercises on Applied Visual Design on FreeCodeCamp(www.freecodecamp.com/learn). Didn't get the chance to finish the last hour of [HTML5 & CSS3 from scratch - Full Course](https://youtu.be/mU6anWqZJcc) which I began watching in the early part of this year. I actually watched [Introduction to Responsive Web Design - HTML & CSS](https://youtu.be/srvUrASNj0s).

**Thoughts**: Today was a laid back day for me. I'm still trying to get use to coding everyday. I have previously studied HTML & CSS, but there are a few things I have to refresh on my memory cause there's alot to remember. I'm just on the third day and I feel like I'm doing too much. =( Too many tutorials sorry. I see why the rules say no tutorials this thing can get confusing. But this is my first round. I promise to be better later on in this challenge.

### Day 4: October 10, 2020 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued the exercises on Applied Visual Design on FreeCodeCamp(www.freecodecamp.com/learn). What stood out to me was the lesson about the Hue of a Color and Scaling. Played around with the different colors and scaling today a tad bit.

**Thoughts**: It's the weekend and I had plans to do over an hour today but unfortuantely I did not have much time. The variety of colors are amazing and the different values you use to show them are quite interesting. The hsl value which was introduced in CSS3 uses a color wheel concept and not a spectrum. *Hmmm I love this already. I get to choose to any color*.

An example of a blue background : 
```
body {
background: hsl(240, 100%, 50%);
}
```
