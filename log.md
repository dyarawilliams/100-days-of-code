# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: October 7, 2020 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I began the Responsive Web Design program. It started with Basic HTML and HTML5 exercises on FreeCodeCamp(www.freecodecamp.com/learn) which consisted of 28 lessons which I completed 100%(28/28). I also watched 2 hours of the youtube video from freeCodeCamp channel(https://youtu.be/mU6anWqZJcc) which is 11 hours and 30 minutes(I'm 10hours into it now).

**Thoughts**: I was introduced to HTML in high school(2009) when I attended an enrichment program known as Clemson Emerging Scholars. During that time we were taught the basic elements so Day 1 of #100DaysOfCode was easy to complete because I remembered quite a few elements.

### Day 2: October 8, 2020 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Basic CSS exercises on FreeCodeCamp(www.freecodecamp.com/learn) which consisted of 44 lessons which I completed 100%(44/44). 

**Thoughts**: Learned about overriding styles in CSS. The second declaration of a class will always take precendence over the first. I have always wondered whether an id or class can override each other, and turns out id overrides class. Also the "!important" keyword overrides all to make sure that the element has specific CSS.

### Day 3: October 9, 2020 Friday

**Today's Progress**: I began the exercises on Applied Visual Design on FreeCodeCamp(www.freecodecamp.com/learn). Didn't get the chance to finish the last hour of [HTML5 & CSS3 from scratch - Full Course](https://youtu.be/mU6anWqZJcc) which I began watching in the early part of this year. I actually watched [Introduction to Responsive Web Design - HTML & CSS](https://youtu.be/srvUrASNj0s).

**Thoughts**: Today was a laid back day for me. I'm still trying to get use to coding everyday. I have previously studied HTML & CSS, but there are a few things I have to refresh on my memory cause there's alot to remember. I'm just on the third day and I feel like I'm doing too much. =( Too many tutorials sorry. I see why the rules say no tutorials this thing can get confusing. But this is my first round. I promise to be better later on in this challenge.

### Day 4: October 10, 2020 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued the exercises on Applied Visual Design on FreeCodeCamp(www.freecodecamp.com/learn). What stood out to me was the lesson about the Hue of a Color and Scaling. Played around with the different colors and scaling today a tad bit.

**Thoughts**: It's the weekend and I had plans to do over an hour today but unfortuantely I did not have much time. The variety of colors are amazing and the different values you use to show them are quite interesting. The hsl value which was introduced in CSS3 uses a color wheel concept and not a spectrum. *Hmmm I love this already. I get to choose any color*.

Examples of color values: 
```
rgb(0, 0, 255)
#0000FF
hsl(240, 100%, 50%)
```

### Day 5: October 11, 2020 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Responsive Web Design: Applied Visual Design on freeCodeCamp. Learned about creating 2D graphics & using keyframes to manipulate animations in CSS. 

A few animation properties:
```
animation-name
animation-duration
animation-timing-function
animation-delay
animation-iteration-count
```

**Thoughts**: 2D graphics are good, but I cant wait until I'm able to do 3D. Drawing a heart and cresent was neat. To be able to manipulate animations is superb. Getting those animations to do exactly what you want them to do I'm amazed.

### Day 6: October 12, 2020 Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Completed 55% of Applied Accessibility on freeCodeCamp. Learned about the new elements that were introduced in HTML5 to make a web design more accessibile. What I learned today was these elements which make the screen reader navigation more simple:`<header>` `<nav>` `<main>` `<article>` `<section>` `<footer>`. 

Also here's a few topics that were covered:
1. Headings Hierarchical
2. Accessibility of Audio content
3. Chart Accessibility using `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`element
4. Form Field Accessibility using `<label>` element
5. Accessibility of Radio Buttons `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` element

**Thoughts**: The new elements introduced in HTML5 gives a better understanding rather than using so many `<div>` element giving it a class or id. How magical is this? I'm definitely going to start using these new elements hopefully it will make it make sense.

### Day 7: October 13, 2020 Tuesday 

**Today's Progress**: Completed 100% of Responsive Web Design: Applied Accessibility section on freeCodeCamp. Worked on my site I started on yesterday and the link is listed below. I have plans to finish it.

Here is a few topics that were covered:
1. Accessible Date Picker & Standard Time `<time datetime="2020-10-20">` 
2. Visually Hide Content in CSS `overflow: hidden;`
3. Avoiding Color Blindness Issues
4. Using brief descriptive text with `<a>` tag
5. Making Links Navigable in HTML with `accesskey` and `tabindex` attributes

**Thoughts**: So I decided to apply some of these topics into creating my own site and I realized that I'm struggling setting up the margins or padding of the content. I can picture how I want my page to be but I can't seem to get it together. Maybe I'm just thinking too hard about it. Putting them into a container sounds best for me, but I still get so confused.

### Day 8: October 14, 2020 Wednesday 

**Today's Progress**: Completed 100% of Responsive Web Design Principles section on freeCodeCamp. Made some changes to the web page I'm creating on Accessibility couldn't figure out why the images were out of the container. 

Here is a few topics that were covered today:
1. Media Queries
2. Making a Image Responsive
3. Using Retina Images for Higher Resoulution Display
4. Making Typography Responsive 

**Thoughts**: The images were wider than the container when I resized the page.(solved it) All I had to do was add the img selector to the CSS stylesheet, then add `max-width` property, and set it to 100% and this makes sure the image is never wider than the container. The `height` property will have a value of auto which keeps the original aspect ratio. Can't wait to get into the Flexbox and Grid section so I would not fear setting up the layout on my own.

### Day 9: October 15, 2020 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Watched freeCodeCamp video on [Introduction to Responsive Web Design - HTML & CSS](https://youtu.be/srvUrASNj0s). Also changed a few things that I learned on Applied Accessibility(see link below). 

**Thoughts**: Today was kinda a rough day, so I decided to watch a video. Didn't get the chance to get into the next section on [freeCodeCamp](www.freecodecamp.com/learn). Didn't come up with a new name for Applied Accessibility web page I created.

### Day 10: October 16, 2020 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Began the lesson [CSS Flexbox on freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/css-flexbox/). 

Here is what I learned:
1. `display: flex;`add to a element when you want to add flex container to
2. `flex-direction`property to align any children of that element into rows or columns. 
3. To fill all the spaces or align container use `justify-content` or `align-items` property

**Thoughts**: Will be doing this for a few days the fact being that this is not my first time doing seeing flexbox and I feel like I would need alot of repetition to fully understand each property of the flexbox. Yesterday Day 9 video that I watched was very helpful because I got to visually see how it is done, so that is great. I'll be working on different types of layouts that I can come up with.

### Day 11: October 17, 2020 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed [CSS Flexbox on freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/css-flexbox/). Also I used the site [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) which was very helpful also. 

Here are the properties I learned today about Flexbox:

1. `flex-wrap` splits a flex item into multiple rows or columns
2. `flex-shrink` allows an item to shrink the flex container, it takes numbers as values
3. `flex-grow` is the opposite of shrink it grows the flex container
4. `flex-basis` specifies the initial size of item before CSS makes adjustments
5. The short hand for flex is `flex: (flex-grow) (flex-shrink) (flex-basis) ;`
6. `align-self` allows you to adjust each item's alignment individually instead of setting them all at once

**Thoughts**: This is going good CSS Flexbox isn't that hard as I was making it seem in the beginning. On the Flexbox Froggy site there was a property that was not introduced in freeCodeCamp's lesson which is `flex-flow` which has the values for the flex-direction and flex-wrap. Example, `flex-flow: (flex-direction) (flex-wrap);`

### Day 12: October 18, 2020 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my Flexbox webpage. Also did some more research on flexbox to get a better understanding from different point of views.

**Thoughts**: Relied on [CSS Flexible Box Layout](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/) for the standard for flex box, but someone who can explain it without so much detail is what I prefered.
