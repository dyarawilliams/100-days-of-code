# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: October 7, 2020 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I began the Responsive Web Design program. It started with Basic HTML and HTML5 exercises on FreeCodeCamp(www.freecodecamp.com/learn) which consisted of 28 lessons which I completed 100%(28/28). I also watched 2 hours of the youtube video from freeCodeCamp channel(https://youtu.be/mU6anWqZJcc) which is 11 hours and 30 minutes(I'm 10hours into it now).

**Thoughts**: I was introduced to HTML in high school(2009) when I attended an enrichment program known as Clemson Emerging Scholars. During that time we were taught the basic elements so Day 1 of #100DaysOfCode was easy to complete because I remembered quite a few elements.

### Day 2: October 8, 2020 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Basic CSS exercises on FreeCodeCamp(www.freecodecamp.com/learn) which consisted of 44 lessons which I completed 100%(44/44). 

**Thoughts**: Learned about overriding styles in CSS. The second declaration of a class will always take precendence over the first. I have always wondered whether an id or class can override each other, and turns out id overrides class. Also the "!important" keyword overrides all to make sure that the element has specific CSS.

### Day 3: October 9, 2020 Friday

**Today's Progress**: I began the exercises on Applied Visual Design on FreeCodeCamp(www.freecodecamp.com/learn). Didn't get the chance to finish the last hour of [HTML5 & CSS3 from scratch - Full Course](https://youtu.be/mU6anWqZJcc) which I began watching in the early part of this year. I actually watched [Introduction to Responsive Web Design - HTML & CSS](https://youtu.be/srvUrASNj0s).

**Thoughts**: Today was a laid back day for me. I'm still trying to get use to coding everyday. I have previously studied HTML & CSS, but there are a few things I have to refresh on my memory cause there's alot to remember. I'm just on the third day and I feel like I'm doing too much. =( Too many tutorials sorry. I see why the rules say no tutorials this thing can get confusing. But this is my first round. I promise to be better later on in this challenge.

### Day 4: October 10, 2020 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued the exercises on Applied Visual Design on FreeCodeCamp(www.freecodecamp.com/learn). What stood out to me was the lesson about the Hue of a Color and Scaling. Played around with the different colors and scaling today a tad bit.

**Thoughts**: It's the weekend and I had plans to do over an hour today but unfortuantely I did not have much time. The variety of colors are amazing and the different values you use to show them are quite interesting. The hsl value which was introduced in CSS3 uses a color wheel concept and not a spectrum. *Hmmm I love this already. I get to choose any color*.

Examples of color values: 
```
rgb(0, 0, 255)
#0000FF
hsl(240, 100%, 50%)
```

### Day 5: October 11, 2020 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Responsive Web Design: Applied Visual Design on freeCodeCamp. Learned about creating 2D graphics & using keyframes to manipulate animations in CSS. 

A few animation properties:
```
animation-name
animation-duration
animation-timing-function
animation-delay
animation-iteration-count
```

**Thoughts**: 2D graphics are good, but I cant wait until I'm able to do 3D. Drawing a heart and cresent was neat. To be able to manipulate animations is superb. Getting those animations to do exactly what you want them to do I'm amazed.

### Day 6: October 12, 2020 Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Completed 55% of Applied Accessibility on freeCodeCamp. Learned about the new elements that were introduced in HTML5 to make a web design more accessibile. What I learned today was these elements which make the screen reader navigation more simple:`<header>` `<nav>` `<main>` `<article>` `<section>` `<footer>`. 

Also here's a few topics that were covered:
1. Headings Hierarchical
2. Accessibility of Audio content
3. Chart Accessibility using `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`element
4. Form Field Accessibility using `<label>` element
5. Accessibility of Radio Buttons `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` element

**Thoughts**: The new elements introduced in HTML5 gives a better understanding rather than using so many `<div>` element giving it a class or id. How magical is this? I'm definitely going to start using these new elements hopefully it will make it make sense.
